# Assignment #2: Linear Algebra Functions

This assignment is meant to give you some practice writing methods that deal
with arrays/lists.

Start Visual Studio Code, create a new folder called `linear` (`File` >
`Open Project..` > `New Folder` > `linear` > `Open`), download the following
files:

* [`linear_algebra.py`](./linear_algebra.py), and
* [`linear_algebra_test.py`](./linear_algebra_test.py),

place these files in the folder just created, open `linear_algebra_text.py`, a
beaker icon should appear on the left, click on that icon, click on `Configure
Python Test`, select the `pytest framework`, select the `Root directory`, wait a
few seconds, then the folder name (`linear`) should appear on the `TESTING` pane
towards the left.  When you hover over the folder name, various icons will
appear to its right.  One of these icons is the play button.  If you click on
it, all tests defined in `linear_algebra_test.py` will run.

You should now be able to run the tests.  12 should fail and 9 should pass
(because those 9 are just verifying that your functions don't do certain
things).

Work your way through `linear_algebra.py`, completing each function so that it
passes the associated tests.

## Hints

Don't modify `linear_algebra_test.py`.

Each function has a `return` statement put there just so that the code compiles.
Replace that statement with your own code (which will include some kind of
`return` statement).

Looking at the tests might give you a hint as to what the code is supposed to
do.

## What To Hand In

Upload your version of `linear_algebra.py`.
