## Visual Studio Code

[Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/development_tools/vs_code.md)
is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  It is "integrated" in that it \
brings together the editor, interpreter, debugger, and other features.

## Main

```python
print('Hello, world!')
```

## A longer main

```python
def main():
    print('Hello, world!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
