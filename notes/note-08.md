## Pair programming

*Pair programming* is a software development process wherein two programmers
work together at one computer.  One programmer takes the role of the *driver*,
thinking about the fine details, actually typing and editing code, and
explaining what they are doing.  The other programmer is the *navigator*,
thinking about the big picture, offering advice and suggestions, asking
questions, and consulting documentation.  The members of the pair should be in
constant conversation so that they can switch roles at any moment.
