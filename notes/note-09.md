# Note 09

## Names

Programmers are constantly called upon to name variables, functions, and other
things.  Choosing names carefully can vastly improve the legibility (and
therefore maintainability) of code.

The number one rule is to be consistent, both within your own program and with
the conventions of your language and team.

### Capitalization

* Variable and function names should use `lower_case_with_underscores`, also
  known as "snake case".
* Constants should use `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`, also known as
  "screaming snake case".
