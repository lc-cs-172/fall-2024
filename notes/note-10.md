## Libraries

A relevant [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) defines a *library*
as

> a collection of read-only resources that is leveraged during software
> development to implement a computer program.

A library is also referred to as a *module*.

## Function composition

Another
[article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science))
defines function composition (or functional composition) as

> an act or mechanism to combine simple functions to build more complicated
> ones.

## Separation of concerns

[Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) (a famous
computer scientist) is often credited with the important design principle called
*separation of concerns*.  This principle calls for

> separating a computer program into distinct sections.  Each section addresses
> a separate concern, a set of information that affects the code of a computer
> program.

In Python, and other programming languages, these sections can be created with
the help of *functions* or *libraries*.
